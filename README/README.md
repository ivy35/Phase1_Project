#  **Aviation Accident Analysis — Phase 1 Project**

> *A Data-Driven Approach to Evaluating Aircraft Safety using the CRISP-DM Framework*

## **1. Project Overview**

This project investigates global aviation accident data spanning **1962–2023**, provided by the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)**.  
The analysis aims to determine which aircraft types and manufacturers present the **lowest operational risk**, guiding business decisions for a company expanding into the aviation sector.

The project applies the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology — ensuring a structured and repeatable process for data-driven insights.
