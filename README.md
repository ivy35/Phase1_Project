##  Business Understanding

The company plans to expand into the **aviation industry** by purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private services. However, there is limited understanding of **aircraft safety risks**, which could lead to poor investment choices and operational losses.

### Key Questions
- Which aircraft types have the most and fewest accidents?  
- How have accident trends changed over time?

- **Executives** – focus on minimizing financial and operational risk.  
- **Operations Team** – responsible for aircraft safety and maintenance.

### Business Value
The analysis supports **data-driven decisions**, reduces **risk exposure**, and helps the company **invest in safer, more reliable aircraft**.
