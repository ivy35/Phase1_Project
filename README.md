##  Business Understanding

The company plans to expand into the **aviation industry** by purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private services. However, there is limited understanding of **aircraft safety risks**, which could lead to poor investment choices and operational losses.

### Objective
Use historical **aviation accident data (1962–2023)** to identify the **safest aircraft types and manufacturers** and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations.

### Key Questions
- Which aircraft types have the most and fewest accidents?  
- How have accident trends changed over time?  
- Which manufacturers have the lowest fatality rates?  
- Which flight phases are most prone to incidents?

### Stakeholders
- **Head of Aviation Division** – makes purchase decisions.  
- **Executives** – focus on minimizing financial and operational risk.  
- **Operations Team** – responsible for aircraft safety and maintenance.

### Business Value
The analysis supports **data-driven decisions**, reduces **risk exposure**, and helps the company **invest in safer, more reliable aircraft**.
##  Data Understanding

The dataset from the **Aviation_Data.csv** covers aviation accidents from **1962–2023**, including details like aircraft make, model, weather, and flight phase.

**Overview**
- Thousands of records across 60+ years.   
- Useful columns for safety and risk analysis.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and trends in aviation accidents.

**Key Insights**
- Most accidents occurred under **clear weather (VMC)**, suggesting human or mechanical causes.  
- **Takeoff and landing** were the riskiest flight phases.  
- Accident rates have **declined over time**, reflecting safety improvements.  
- Some **manufacturers** showed consistently lower fatality rates.

**Next Step:** Perform deeper analysis and visualizations to support business recommendations.
